# EigenWrapper

EigenWrapper project

This project is to transform points that users gives to the program.
It uses Eigen3 library for matrixes and vector input from the user.
There are 1 lib file .hh, 1 lib.cc file and the main file.
Based on the function that user calles, you can transform a point
that you give on the system, it will be one transformation per point.
But there is also a function called TransformAllPoint, which will
implement all the transformation on one point.
