# EigenWrapper
Eigen is a CPP library that helps with matrixes and vectors.
The idea was to create a program with different functions that will make changes to the point in a 3-dimensional space.
It also has splog library to inform the user easier about the program behaviors. It contains warnings, errors, info, and more.
I have used Cmake for compiling, building, and testing the program

*Next task - Google tests!
